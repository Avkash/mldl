# H2O Stacked Ensemble - Binomial Classification in Python # 

H2O’s Stacked Ensemble method is supervised ensemble machine learning algorithm that finds the optimal combination of a collection of prediction algorithms using a process called stacking. This method currently supports regression and binary classification.

## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this example can be obtained from here:
